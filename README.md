# face-recognition

This code implements a face recognition system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.
The system utilizes a training phase which involves extracting faces from a labelled dataset and training a model using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm. 
The trained model is then utilized for face recognition on new images.
The face recognition system can be used for various applications, such as access control, surveillance, attendance systems, and personalized user experiences.
The face recognition system implemented using OpenCV has demonstrated its capability to accurately recognize faces in new images.
